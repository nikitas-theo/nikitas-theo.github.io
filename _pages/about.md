I am a researcher interested in machine learning, language, and human cognition.   
Currently searching/applying for PhD positions.

Feel free to reach me at: `nikitastheodorop@gmail.com`   
See other ways to connect bellow.   
You can find my **CV** here: [link <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i>](assets/pdf/cv_nikitas_theodoropoulos.pdf).



**Research Interests**\
I am interested in the ways machine and human intelligence interact, and how we can use one to learn more about the other, with a special focus on language.   

Some of the topics I am interested in are:
- Computational linguistics
- Language acquisition
- Interpretability
- Mutlilinguality and low-resource languages
- Mutlimodality, and language grounding
- Multi-agent interaction and communication
- Language evolution
- Symbolic and neuro-symbolic methods


**Sort CV**\
I graduated with a BSc & MSc in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I completed my thesis at the [AILS](https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr/) group of NTUA supervised by Prof. [Giorgos Stamou](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/174). Our research investigated language modeling with human-like data constraints of at most 100 million words, as part of the 2024 [BabyLM](https://babylm.github.io/) Challenge.


I interned with the [Machine Teaching](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/) group at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) where I was advised by Prof. [Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html). Our work focused on AI for programming education. Given a struggling student's attempt on a known programming task, we first identify the student's misconception, and then use it simulate student behavior by synthesizing their attempt for a novel but similar problem.

In the past, I also conducted research on learning brain-derived (fMRI) linguistic representations, working with Prof. [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp-ntua.github.io/potam/) in the [Speech and Language](https://slp-ntua.github.io/index.html) group at NTUA.

<!-- If there is any help/advice I can give, or you just want to chat about common interests, feel free to reach out. -->
In my free time I enjoy indoors climbing ðŸ§—, playing the piano ðŸŽ¹, and reading ðŸ“š.   
I also like to learn new and exciting programming languages, and I am interested in open-source, self-hosted software.
