Hello! 
I am currently in the process of submitting PhD applications.


**Research Interests**\
My main research interests include natural language processing (NLP), human-like language modeling, language acquisition, and cognitive science. I am also interested in (multi-agent) reinforcement learning and symbolic AI.



**Sort CV**\
I hold a BSc & MSc in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I completed my thesis at the [AILS](https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr/) group of NTUA supervised by Prof. [Giorgos Stamou](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/174). Our research investigated language modeling with human-like data constraints of at most 100 million words, as part of the 2024 [BabyLM](https://babylm.github.io/) challenge.


I interned with the [Machine Teaching](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/) group at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) where I was advised by Prof. [Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html). Our work focused on AI for programming education, identifying student misconceptions and synthesizing possible student attempts for novel tasks in block-based visual programming. 

In the past I also conducted research on learning brain-derived (fMRI) linguistic representations, working with Prof. [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp-ntua.github.io/potam/) in the [Speech and Language](https://slp-ntua.github.io/index.html) group at NTUA. 


**More about me**\
I enjoy indoors climbing ðŸ§—, playing the piano ðŸŽ¹, and reading ðŸ“š.
