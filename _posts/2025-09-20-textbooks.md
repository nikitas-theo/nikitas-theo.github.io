### Introduction
I've always been interested in learning new things and diving deeply into a topic. For this reason, I make a habit of collecting and evaluating learning resources, for all the various subjects I am interested in. In an effort to assist others who, like me, might be looking for the best way to approach a new area of interest, I have curated here a list of resources I've collected over the years. Disclaimer: on many (all) of these I am not an expert, and I am just sharing my personal views and experience:) 


#### General Machine Learning

Deep Learning book by Ian Goodfelow and Yashua Bengio, continues to be an excellent textbook, even in the modern ML landscape â€” 10 years later. Notation and writing can be a little dense, but nevertheless, It was a valuable resource for me. 



#### Natural Language Processing

The classic reccomended read for modern NLP is Speech and Language Processing 
Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin, available for free as a draft [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). 

I personally really reccomend the video series of Karpathy. Both, [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)
and his [General Audience videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuW9U8-vZ_s_cjKPT_FqRStI) about AI. One instructive repo on training LMs is [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)



#### Linguistics (for NLP)

#### Statistics

#### Cognitive Sciecne

#### Music Theory

#### Science Fiction

#### Classic Literature
